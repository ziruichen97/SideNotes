# Privacy Policy for Web Page Saver

Web Page Saver is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in relation to our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

Web Page Saver does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All information saved through the extension (including bookmarked pages, notes, and preferences) is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API.

## Data Storage

The following data is stored locally in your browser:

- URLs of saved webpages
- Custom notes associated with saved webpages
- Aliases for saved webpages
- Dark mode preference

This data is only accessible on your local device and is not shared with the extension developers or any third parties.

## Permissions

The extension requires certain permissions to function properly:

- `storage`: To save and retrieve your bookmarked pages and notes locally.
- `activeTab`: To interact with the current tab for saving the current page.
- `scripting`: To inject necessary scripts for the extension's functionality.

These permissions are used solely for the purpose of providing the extension's core features and do not involve data collection or transmission.

## Data Export and Import

The extension provides functionality to export and import your saved data. This process is entirely under your control and does not involve any external servers. The exported data file is created and saved locally on your device.
