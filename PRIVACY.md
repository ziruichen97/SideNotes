# Privacy Policy for SideNotes

Last updated: [2024.9.10]

## Introduction

SideNotes is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our browser extension.

## Information Collection and Use

### Local Storage
SideNotes stores all user data locally on your device using browser storage mechanisms. This includes:
- Saved webpages and their associated notes
- User preferences (e.g., dark mode settings)
- Extension configuration

We do not transmit or store any of this information on external servers.

### Permissions
SideNotes requires certain browser permissions to function:
- "storage": To save and retrieve your notes and preferences locally
- "activeTab": To interact with the current tab for saving and displaying notes
- "scripting": To inject content scripts for the notes overlay
- "tabs": To access tab information for saving and retrieving notes

## Host Permission Jurisdiction

This extension requests permission to access and interact with web content on the following domains:

- `https://*.example.com/*`
- `https://api.someservice.com/*`

These permissions are necessary for the core functionality of SideNotes, allowing it to save and interact with webpages on these specified domains. We do not access or collect data from any other websites or domains not listed here.

## Data Security

We implement security measures to protect your locally stored data:
- All data is stored using browser-provided encryption mechanisms
- The extension does not have access to or transmit data from other websites or extensions

## Third-Party Services

SideNotes does not use any third-party analytics or tracking services. The only third-party resource used is Font Awesome for icons, which is included locally and does not transmit any data.

## Data Sharing and Transfer

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any of your information with third parties.

## User Rights

As all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your information. You can:
- View, edit, or delete your saved notes at any time through the extension interface
- Export your data for backup purposes
- Uninstall the extension to remove all associated data from your device

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
